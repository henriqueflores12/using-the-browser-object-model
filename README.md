# using-the-browser-object-model

the += operator adds data onto the end of the msg variable
the object model window object's properties innerWidth and innerHieght
show width and hiegt of the browser window an display all this in only one id "info"
the window object alert() method is used to create a dialog box show on the top of the page it is known as an "alert box"
although this is a method of the window object you may see it used on its own as shown here because the window object is treated as the default object if none is specified historically alert() method was used to display warnings to users these days there are better ways to provide feedback...
